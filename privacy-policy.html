<h2>3. iCloud (Planned Feature)</h2>
<p>In the future, Yeasta may offer <strong>optional iCloud syncing</strong> to allow you to back up and sync data across devices. This would use <strong>Appleâ€™s iCloud infrastructure</strong> and would be <strong>tied to your Apple ID</strong>, not accessed or managed by the app developer.</p>
